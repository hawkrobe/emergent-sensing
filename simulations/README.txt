Configurations are set by config.py

run `python run_simulations.py` to launch a big grid of different parameter settings

to visualize a simulation run as a video, run, e.g., `sh make_video.sh output/predictions-emergent/spot-2-asocial-1-`

note that you must have [`ffmpeg`](http://ffmpeg.org) installed (on mac, you can get it via homebrew with `brew install ffmpeg`)

in the paper, we focus on the core qualitative predictions evaluated in exp. 1, but simulations related to the other two experiments can be found in `supplemental```
