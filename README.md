# Emergent collective sensing in human groups

* `experiments` contains the code to reproduce all of the behavioral experiments. 
* `data` contains the raw data from these experiments. 
* `analyses` contains R notebooks to produce all figures and statistics reported in the paper. run from the top level directory after installing necessary R libraries
* `simulations` contains the code to reproduce the simulations with different computational models.

# Raw data

Raw data files for Exp. 1 and Exp. 3 are too large to be checked into this repository. 

To reproduce full Exp. 1 preprocessing pipeline, unzip the raw tick-by-tick data [stored here](https://emergent-sensing.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/exp1_raw_games.zip) and place it in `/data/experiment1/`.

To reproduce full Exp. 3 preprocessing pipeline, unzip the state-annotated data [stored here](https://emergent-sensing.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/exp3_processed_data.zip) and place it in `/data/experiment3`.
