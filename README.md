# Emergent collective sensing in human groups

* `experiments` contains the code to reproduce all of the behavioral experiments. 
* `data` contains the raw data from these experiments. follow instructions in data/README.md
* `analyses` contains R notebooks to produce all figures and statistics reported in the paper. run from the top level directory after installing necessary R libraries
* `simulations` contains the code to reproduce the simulations with different computational models.
